The solution is to simply use the formula for the nth triangle number: *n(n+1)
2*. For example, the first ten triangle numbers are: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45 and 55. So we can easily calculate that 32 is a triangle number by applying the formula.

Lithium_4 has an electron configuration of: 1)2), meaning it has 1 electron in its first shell and 2 electrons in its second shell. Electrons are always torn from their last occupied orbital when an ionization occurs (remember that orbitals are ordered by energy). In this case, if we tear one more away from Lithium-4, it will have a configuration of: 1)1 2)2. This means that there is one more electron on Lithium-3's first orbital than on Lithium-3's second orbital (the opposite holds for Li"
